<ul type="disk">
<li>The history of Panhala is closely linked with the history of the Maratha empire, and with its founder, Chatrapati Shivaji Raje.</li><br>
<li>Panhala is the only fort where Shivaji spent more than 500 days, other than his childhood homes.</li><br>
<li>It was Maratha State capital until 1782 and in 1827 it became part of the British Empire.</li><br>
<li>This imposing fort, 20 km northwest of Kolhapur, is built on an outlying spur of the Sahyadris, rising more than 400 m above plain, and is the largest of all the Deccan forts.</li><br>
<li>The strategic importance of Panhala, guarding one of the principal routes through the Western Ghat, can be judged from its long and varied history.</li><br>
<li>Built between 1178 and 1209, it first served as the headquarters of the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II, and subsequently passed into hands of the Yadavas.</li><br>
<li>It was a favorite outpost of the Bahamanis of Bidar; Mahmud Gawan, the powerful prime minister, encamped here during the rainy season of 1469.</li><br>
<li>By the beginning of the 16th century Panhala was absorbed into the kingdom of Bijapur.</li><br>
<li>The Adil Shahis were responsible for strengthening and rebuilding the ramparts and gateways.</li><br>
<li>The fort was raided by Shivaji in 1659, but it was not until 1673 that he was able to occupy it permanently.</li>
